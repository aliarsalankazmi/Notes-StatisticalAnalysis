# Data Types

1. Non-Metric
  - Ordinal: Categorical variables that denote some kind of order.
  - Nominal: Categorical variables that only denote nomination and not any order.
2. Metric
  - Ratio: Such variables allow one to measure intervals between their values, as well as ratios - they have an absolute zero point.
  - Interval: Such variables allow one to take intervals between values, only.
3. Summated Scales: In such a scale, several variables are joined in a composite measure.


# Basic Statistics

* Statistical Population: A **complete** set of items that share at least a single property.
* Sample: A set of data collected from the Statistical Population.
