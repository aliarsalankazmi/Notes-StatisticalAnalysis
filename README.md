Notes pertaining to univariate/multivariate statistical analysis
================================================================


## Data Types

1. Non-Metric
  - Ordinal: Categorical variables that denote some kind of order.
  - Nominal: Categorical variables that only denote nomination and not any order.
2. Metric
  - Ratio: Such variables allow one to measure intervals between their values, as well as ratios - they have an absolute zero point.
  - Interval: Such variables allow one to take intervals between values, only.
3. Summated Scales: In such a scale, several variables are joined in a composite measure.


## Basic Statistics

* Statistical Population: A **complete** set of items that share at least a single property.

* Sample: A **set** of data collected from the Statistical Population.

* Frequency Distribution: A set of data that denotes how often (that is, the *distribution*) each value occurs in a sample. These distributions may take up different forms: Normal distribution, T-distribution, Binomial distribution, etc.

* Central Tendency: Where the centre of a frequency distribution lies. There are several ways of finding the central tendency:
  - 

    mySample <- c(2,34,6,3,4,6,87,19)
